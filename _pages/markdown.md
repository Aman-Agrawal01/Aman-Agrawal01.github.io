## Quantum Computing 

* Introduction 
    * [Quantum Computing and Quantum Information by Michael Nielsen and Issac Chuang](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149940643.pdf) 

* Quantum Algorithms, Complexity, Cryptography 
    * [Lecture Notes by Andrew Childs](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~amchilds/qa/) 
    * [Lecture Notes by Ronald de Wolf](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf) 
    * [Lecture Notes by Ryan O'Donnell](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/quantum18/)
    * [Lecture Notes by Scott Aaronson](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-845-quantum-complexity-theory-fall-2010/lecture-notes/)       

## Deep Learning 

* [Deep Learning Drizzle](https://deep-learning-drizzle.github.io/) 
    * This site contains the links for courses ranging from basics to more advanced stuffs. 
    * For Programming, I earlier use to code in Tensorflow 2 (TF2) and Keras but shifted to PyTorch. I will recommend the [tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) of PyTorch from their official website. For TF2 and Keras, look at the courses by deeplearning.ai in Coursera.
