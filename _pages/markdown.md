## Quantum Computing 

* [Quantum Computing and Quantum Information by Michael Nielsen and Issac Chuang](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149940643.pdf) 
    * This is an introductory yet a brief book on Quantum Computing. You can look at the first 6 chapters if you are looking to learn Quantum Computing. 

* [Lecture Notes on Quantum Algorithms by Andrew Childs](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~amchilds/qa/) 
    * This is more of an advanced resource specifically on quantum algorithms and to some extent query complexity.
