I am currently a third year undergraduate from [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) majoring in [Mathematics and Scientific Computing](https://www.iitk.ac.in/math/). 

Interests
======
I am interested in [Quantum Computation and its Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#:~:text=Quantum%20computing%20is%20a%20type,are%20known%20as%20quantum%20computers.). The 'weird properties' of quantum systems changes the way of our computation as we usually do in the case of classical computing. 

I am also interested in [Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) and Deep Learning. Currently, I am exploring [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network). The most interesting part of GANs for me is the wide variety of applications we see combined with logic and some maths!

Apart from academics, I am fond of watching sports and playing piano.
