I am currently a third year undergraduate from [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) majoring in [Mathematics and Scientific Computing](https://www.iitk.ac.in/math/). 

Interests
======
I am interested in [Quantum Computation and its Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#:~:text=Quantum%20computing%20is%20a%20type,are%20known%20as%20quantum%20computers.). The best thing about Quantum is the 'weird properties' of quantum systems that changes the way of our computation as we usually do in the case of classical computing. I am also interested in Deep Learning.

Apart from academics, I am fond of watching sports and playing piano.
